## Household Labor Supply Elasticities: Evidence from the 2015 Swiss Franc Appreciation
(joint work with Sarah Lein, Andreas Peichl, Kurt Schmidheiny, and Peter Zorn)

This paper investigates the labor supply responses of German cross-border commuters following a significant exchange rate shock resulting from the unexpected abandonment of the minimum exchange rate policy by the Swiss National Bank in 2015. With a focus on over 45,000 cross-border workers employed in Switzerland, earning their income in Swiss Francs, and residing in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, we examine the implications of this shock on their labor supply decisions, considering the majority of their income is spent in Euros.

Utilizing the exchange rate shock as a natural experiment, we estimate the own wage and spousal labor supply responses. Our research design has several appealing features: it was a large and unexpected shock (approximately a 10\% real wage hike), it was a salient source of income variation, and we are immune to a lack of bunching or anticipatory effects. To conduct our empirical analysis, we leverage the rich German Taxpayer Panel (TPP) provided by the research data center of the Federal Statistical Office, covering the period from 2012 to 2018. This comprehensive administrative microdata is derived from personal income tax returns, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our estimations. 

We adopt a panel-event study regression framework to compare the earnings of cross-border commuters and their spouses with individuals solely employed in Germany and their spouses. Our extensive dataset enables us to estimate heterogeneous effects across multiple dimensions. Specifically, we explore potential variations in treatment effects based on marital status, considering insurance motives within households and tax incentives associated with joint taxation. Additionally, we examine differences between couples consisting of single cross-border commuters versus those with dual cross-border commuters, wherein the exchange rate shock impacts both individuals. We further consider heterogeneity by gender, age, income, the number of children, and the distinction between primary and secondary earners.

Preliminary findings reveal an own-wage elasticity of approximately -0.55, indicating that German cross-border commuters responded to the exchange rate shock by adjusting their labor supply. Furthermore, we observe a spousal elasticity of around -0.30, signifying a similar response from the spouses of cross-border workers. Notably, the own-wage elasticity is found to be more pronounced for singles, primary earners, and individuals with higher incomes. Intriguingly, female cross-border workers married to non-cross-border workers do not exhibit a significant reduction in their labor supply.

To bolster the robustness and validity of our findings, we plan to complement our analysis with additional evidence from the Swiss side of the border, leveraging Swiss social security data. By comparing cross-border workers with Swiss residents at the firm level, we aim to further isolate the impact of the exchange rate shock. This supplementary information will also enable us to rule out potential earnings changes among cross-border commuters resulting from occupation-specific income trends or labor demand fluctuations. 

Through these methodological enhancements and the utilization of extensive datasets, our research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the labor supply responses of German cross-border commuters in the wake of a significant exchange rate shock. In addition, by investigating the heterogeneous effects across various dimensions, we shed light on the underlying dynamics. 

## Testing identification in mediation & dynamic treatment models
(joint work with Martin Huber, and Lukas Laffers)

We propose a method for testing the identification of causal effects in causal mediation and dynamic treatment models when covariates, as well as suspected instruments (which supposedly do not directly affect the outcome), are observed in the data, building on the test by \citet{huberkueck2022} for single treatment models. The models considered in our study are characterized by a sequential assignment of a treatment and a mediator to assess the direct effect of the treatment (net of the mediator), the indirect effect of the treatment (via the mediator), or the joint effect of both the treatment and the mediator. We derive testable conditions that are sufficient for the identification of such effects in observational data. These conditions imply the joint satisfaction of the exogeneity of the treatment and the mediator conditional on covariates, as well as the validity of (at least two) distinct instruments for the treatment and the mediator, meaning that the instruments do not directly affect the outcome (other than through the treatment or mediator) and are unconfounded conditional on the covariates. Our method also applies to sample selection or post-treatment attrition problems in which the mediator is replaced by a selection indicator for the observability of the outcome, in order to jointly test the ignorability of treatment and sample selection.  We propose machine learning-based tests that control for covariates in a data-driven way and analyze their finite sample performance in a simulation study. We also apply our testing approach to empirical data.
